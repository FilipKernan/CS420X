For the final project I was interested in working with strange attractors. Strange attractors are a type of equation that is not reliant on time. Additionally, the path that a single agent might take is extremely sensitive to the initial conditions. These can create really weird and bizarre shapes. I looked through a number of strange attractor equations and landed on the De Jong attractor for itâ€™s simplicity and its beauty. The implementation of the simulation was not that difficult as the new agent position is a simple function of its current position. I also created simple sliders to adjust the four coefficients so that a user could explore different shapes that the simulation can create. I then played around with some of the coefficients to create three presets that I thought were interesting. However, while I was playing with these coefficients, I found that for some values the simulation will collapse to one or more pixels. All changes to the coefficients after this would then look dull as there would be no difference in the initial starting condition. To elevate this issue I created a simple reset button that would reseed the simulation with agents in random locations. 
	Once the simulation was complete, I noticed that while the shapes that the attractor makes are visually interesting, there is both a lot of black space on the screen and no movement in relation to time. To fix this I added two post processing effects. The first was a simple offset feedback. This feedback features both a color shift and an offset which results in the simulation having a number of color shifted clones that appear behind it. The second post processing effect that I added was a type of flame effect. I wanted to create the appearance that the attractor was burning and flames were sprouting up from it. To do this I created another fragment shader. First I created a pseudo-random location that pixel would sample from, and if the point and the point below it had a blue value above some threshold, the pixel would be given a flame color. This resulted in a flame effect that you might see from a propane cooking stove. The offset was seeded with time and with the current x coordinate in order to create some semblance of continuity and change over time. Unfortunately I was not able to fix the fact that it looks like the flames are moving one direction and then the next.
