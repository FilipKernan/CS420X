I created what amounts to a pulsing blue line in the steady state. I did this by modifying the kill and feed rates based on the screen coordinates. Initially I explored the effect that changing the diffusion rates would have on the simulation, but I did not find that visual interesting. I modified the kill and feed rates by multiplying them by the absolute value of their normalized position, relative to the center of the screen. This resulted in this pulsing effect, but I found that I could not quite see the contrast between the red and blue that well. To fix this, I created an absolute minimum for the feed rate of 0.005, to ensure that chemical A is always being fed into the reaction. This also has the convenient effect of ensuring that the reaction is never able to reach a state where there is only A or B on the screen. The pulsing effect also created black aftershocks that followed the waves when the kill rate was set above 0.023. I decided to allow the user to still change the kill rate below that, as due to the above change with the feed rate, the reaction is able to recover from being changed to such a state.
